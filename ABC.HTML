        <P>People often use the word passage to specifically refer to a journey by ship, as in, "
             The passage to America was long and hard." A section of written work or music can also
              be called a passage. You can think of a passage of music as moving the listener from one
               part of the piece to the next. And, finally, you can call a path a passage or passageway, 
               especially when it's narrow. A street is not a passage, but the little tunnel behind the 
               secret door in your closet is certainly a passage.
